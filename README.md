# qgg-labs

These are all the computer labs I wrote for a class I TA'd entitled, Quantiative Genetics and Genomics at Cornell University and Weill Cornell Medicine.  The base of the computer labs were written by Zoe Zhao, you can get see these labs at https://github.com/zoezhao997/BTRY6830 .  There are also video lectures that well correspond to the fundamental mathematics and biology of each lab.  You can find these videos at http://mezeylab.cb.bscb.cornell.edu/Classes.aspx.  

There may still be some bugs within the labs, but for the most part they are great.  From basic R to MCMC, these labs provide a way to learn R in the context of genetics.  The labs are all based in R-Markdown, which is something I have not seen in many other R lessons so hopefully you can take advantage of that fact here.  The contents of the labs are as follows:

### Lab 1 - R Basics
  - R as a calculator
  - Matrices and data frames
  
### Lab 2 - R Slightly Beyond Basics
  - R Markdown
  - Functions
  - For Loops
  - If Statements
  - Vector and Matrix calculations
  
### Lab 3 - R More Beyond Basics
  - Plotting
  - Probability Distributions
  
### Lab 4 - R Further Beyond Basics
  - Boolean Data
  - Fancy vector indexing
  - Dealing with missing data
  
### Lab 5 - R Beyond Basics
  - Pseudo-random numbers
  - Pasting
  - Speeding up your code
  
### Lab 6 - Genetics!
  - Reading in genotype data
  - Coding genotype data
  
### Lab 7 - Genetic Association Testing
  - Performing hypothesis test on variants
  - Producing Manhattan plots
  
### Lab 8 - GWAS
  - Performing many association tests
  - QQ-Plots
  - Multiple hypothesis testing corrections
  - Principal Components Analysis

### Lab 9 - Real eQTL Analysis
